# Spotify integration for GitHub readme
This repository is a fork of https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem, that allows you get your current Spotify playing song on a GitHub readme - for example - and being deployed on Vercel. More information about setting up that stuff here: https://github.com/novatorem/novatorem/blob/master/SetUp.md
